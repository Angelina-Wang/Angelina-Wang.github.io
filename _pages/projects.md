## Pairings

Developed a modified version of the Stable Marriage Algorithm that works even when each member doesn't rank every other member. Reads from and writes to a Google Sheet using the API.

## Message Decoder App

Built an app that, given a keyword, can encrypt and decrypt messages based on the Vigenere cipher.

## Text Editor
A text editor built from scratch that has clicking, cursor, scroll bar, word wrap, open/save, size, and undo/redo capabilities. Blinking cursor moves based on click location in constant time by maintaining linked lists of the characters in each line, and which characters are before or after the cursor.
