## Work Hard Pay Hard

Built a chrome extension that allows you to designate certain websites that you are trying to avoid during a productive work session so that you will donate a specified amount of money to a charity of your choice if you visit the banned website. Now available in the chrome store. Created during UC Davis's Hackathon under the team name HackDavisToBits.

## Pairings

Developed a modified version of the Stable Marriage Algorithm that works even when each member doesn't rank every other member. Reads from and writes to a Google Sheet using the API.

## Message Decoder App

Built an app that, given a keyword, can encrypt and decrypt messages based on the Vigenere cipher.

## Text Editor
A text editor built from scratch that has clicking, cursor, scroll bar, word wrap, open/save, size, and undo/redo capabilities. Blinking cursor moves based on click location in constant time by maintaining linked lists of the characters in each line, and which characters are before or after the cursor.
