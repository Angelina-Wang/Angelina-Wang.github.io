## CapsLock

Outfitted a Generative Adversarial Network with the discriminator component composed of a Capsule Net. Created as a final project during Spring 2018 offering of CS194-129: Designing, Visualizing, and Understanding Deep Neural Networks, blog located [*here*](https://franklinrice.github.io/cs194-capsule-gan/).

## Work Hard Pay Hard

Built a chrome extension that allows you to designate certain websites that you are trying to avoid during a productive work session so that you will donate a specified amount of money to a charity of your choice if you visit the banned website. Now available in the chrome store. Created during UC Davis's Hackathon under the team name HackDavisToBits.

## Pairings

Developed a modified version of the Stable Marriage Algorithm that works even when each member doesn't rank every other member. Reads from and writes to a Google Sheet using the API.
